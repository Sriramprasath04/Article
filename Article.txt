Git Basic Cmds


1)How to config?

------------------------------------------------------------

2)How to create a Project Folder & File using Cmd in Bash?

cd ---> Move Pannurathuku
mkdir folder_name ---> Folder Create Pannurathuku
touch file_name.extension ---> to create a File (Article.txt)
--------------------------------------------------------------

3)How to make our Project Folder into a git Repo?

git init ---> Used to initaillze a Empty Git Repository
--------------------------------------------------------------

4)Status of the Repo?

git status ---> current Status of the repository
--------------------------------------------------------------

5)How to view the History/log of the Commits done?

---------------------------------------------------------------------

7)Commiting the information to Master

git commit --->Saving the changes we have made to the Master
---------------------------------------------------------------
Three areas of Git

	-> Working Directory
	-> Staging Area
	-> Repository

		Repository:
			> Local
			> Remote 


Three Ways to Git

	-> addding git to New Project
	-> addding git to existing project
	-> cloning someone else project


	Addding git to New Project :

		Step 1: One the New Project -> Right click -> Open "Git Bash here " (This make the Git Bash to open with the current location)
		Step 2: Cmd "git init" (To make the current Folder as working directory )
	
	Addding git to existing project :
		Step 1: One the New Project -> Right click -> Open "Git Bash here "
		Step 2: Cmd "git init" (To make the current Folder as working directory )
		Step 3: Cmd "git status" (It shows all the files in the existing project ,we have to add all the files to it)	
		Step 4: Cmd "git add ." (To add all the folders to git)
		Step 5: Cmd "git commit -m "Type the msg" (To commit)

	Cloning someone else project :
		Step 1: Go to GitHub
		Step 2: Search for the required Github repo 
		Step 3: Click "Code"( to downgload)
		Step 4: Then cpy the address(https mosly)
		Step 5: Move to the destination folder where you want to clone it
		Step 6: Right click,then open "Git Bash here " 
		Step 7: Cmd "git clone 'paste_the_URL",then press ENTER



---------------------------------------------------------------
GitHub -> Push (To save the local files to remote) -> Pull (To save the remote files to local)
---------------------------------------------------------------

. The things that we all done before using git is tracked and stored in the local repository only.
. There are lots of service-providers avaliable for creating Remote Repository of git.
. Where Github is one of the most popular service-provider of git.

> Create a GitHub account
> In header bar,at the right corner you can find a '+' icon click it -> New repository -> Give repository name -> Create repository

There you can find some instructions on creating a new repo on cmd, push an existing repo from cmd,import code from another repo

GitHub Push and Pull operations between local and remote

	-> Open 'Git bash'
	-> git remote add url_name URL (Note: url_name can be any i.e,user defined or default/most-popular 'origin') (The URL is stored in the url_name)
	-> git branch -M main (This is line isto rename the existing branch named master into main) (.'. optional)
	-> git push -u origin main (-u = upstream stting) (This line says, to push the main branch into the URL which is stored in url_name i.e, origin )

	-> git pull origin (To save the remote objects to local)


we don't need to memorize each and every cmds git helps us
	> git help
	> git help cmd (where cmd referes to the cmd which you have doubt about [eg. git help remote])
